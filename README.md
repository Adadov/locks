This is work in progress.

Aim: Create objects that can be locked and shared.

Comes with a chest and sign. Ought to work with xdoors2locked.

Who can open/use a locked object?
- the owner (always)
- anyone with the diglocks priv
- anyone with the openlocks priv (only use - not dig)
- anyone whose name has been added by the owner with the /add playername command
- anyone who knows and types in the password that the owner did set with /set thisisthepassword

TODO:
- check if players added via /add playername actually exist
- add groups of players for easier handling (i.e. a group :trusted for trusted users)
- add key and keychain as objects required to use locked objects
- add crafting receipes
- better handling of the name of the object
